LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_ctrl/u0_sw/mode_reg_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_ctrl/mode_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_ctrl/u0_sw/mode_reg_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_ctrl/mode_reg_C/CLR, u_ctrl/mode_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

An input delay is missing on btn0_in relative to clock(s) sys_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn1_in relative to clock(s) sys_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn2_in relative to clock(s) sys_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn3_in relative to clock(s) sys_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on tx relative to clock(s) sys_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_ctrl/mode_reg_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_ctrl/mode_reg_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
